# Phase 28

## Phase 28 — Public-Facing UI Foundations

### Goal

Prepare the unauthenticated, public-facing experience.

---

### Scope

- `/` public landing page
- Read-only views
- No authentication required
- No visibility into No Bid area

---

### Exit Criteria

- Public UI functional
- Admin UI unaffected

---

## Rationale for Ordering

- Identity first prevents future rewrites
- State machines before UI avoid hacks
- No Bid before CSV expansion prevents data leaks
- Rounds before bidding avoids premature logic
- UI polish last saves time
