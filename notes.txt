Resume Phase 30.

Refer to:

plans/PHASE_30.md

all Phase 30 sub-phase documents

AGENTS.md

plans/PHASE_30_WORKING_STATE.md

Follow the Phase Planning & Execution Protocol.

Continue from the current working state.
Update the working state document before pausing or completing a sub-phase.
When using git commands, be mindful the system auto uses pagers, so commands may appear to hang. Use no-pager as appropriate.
If we need to pause for a new context window, ensure CI passes. If there is too much work for the CI to be able to pass, commit with "--no-verify" and note in the commit message.

Do not reinterpret scope or invariants.

git rebase -i HEAD~5
git commit --amend -S --no-edit
git rebase --continue
